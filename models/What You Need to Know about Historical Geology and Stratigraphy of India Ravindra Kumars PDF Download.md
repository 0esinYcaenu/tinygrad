Stratigraphy is the branch of geology that deals with the study of the arrangement and succession of rock layers or strata. It helps to reconstruct the geological history of a region by correlating and dating the rock units based on their lithology, fossils, and other features. Stratigraphy also provides information on the past environments, climates, and life forms that existed on Earth.
 
India has a rich and varied stratigraphic record that spans over 4 billion years of Earth's history. The oldest rocks in India are the Archean gneisses and granites that form the basement of the Indian shield. The youngest rocks are the alluvial deposits and soils that cover the plains and deltas. In between, there are several sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic formations that reflect the different stages of India's geological evolution.
 
Some of the major stratigraphic divisions of India are:

- The Dharwar system: This consists of the oldest sedimentary rocks in India, which were deposited in the Archean era. They are mainly composed of quartzites, slates, phyllites, schists, and iron formations. They are exposed in parts of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala.
- The Cuddapah system: This comprises the Proterozoic sedimentary rocks that overlie the Dharwar system. They are mainly composed of sandstones, shales, limestones, dolomites, and conglomerates. They are exposed in parts of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Odisha.
- The Vindhyan system: This consists of the Proterozoic to Cambrian sedimentary rocks that overlie the Cuddapah system. They are mainly composed of sandstones, shales, limestones, and quartzites. They are exposed in parts of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar, and Jharkhand.
- The Gondwana system: This comprises the Paleozoic to Mesozoic sedimentary rocks that were deposited in the Gondwana supercontinent. They are mainly composed of sandstones, shales, coal seams, and conglomerates. They are exposed in parts of Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala.
- The Deccan Traps: This consists of the Cretaceous to Paleogene volcanic rocks that cover most of the peninsular India. They are mainly composed of basaltic lava flows and interbedded sediments. They are exposed in parts of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala.
- The Tertiary system: This comprises the Paleogene to Neogene sedimentary rocks that were deposited in the Himalayan foreland basin and the coastal margins. They are mainly composed of sandstones, shales, limestones, clays, and lignites. They are exposed in parts of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand,
Punjab,
Haryana,
Delhi,
Uttar Pradesh,
Bihar,
West Bengal,
Assam,
Arunachal Pradesh,
Nagaland,
Manipur,
Mizoram,
Tripura,
Meghalaya,
Sikkim,
Gujarat,
Maharashtra,
Goa,
Karnataka,
Kerala,
Tamil Nadu,
Andhra Pradesh,
Odisha,
and Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
- The Quaternary system: This consists of the Pleistocene to Holocene sedimentary rocks that cover most of India. They are mainly composed of alluvial deposits,
glacial deposits,
aeolian deposits,
lacustrine deposits,
marine deposits,
and soils.
They are exposed in almost all parts of India.
