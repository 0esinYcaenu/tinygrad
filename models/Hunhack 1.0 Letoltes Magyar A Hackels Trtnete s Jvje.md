Hunhack 1.0 is a controversial and dangerous tool that poses a serious threat to the security and integrity of Hungarian websites. It also raises questions about the role and responsibility of hackers in society, and the balance between freedom of information and respect for law and order.

One of the most notorious examples of websites that have been hacked by Hunhack 1.0 is the official website of the Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orban. On April 15, 2023, hackers used Hunhack 1.0 to replace the homepage of the website with a message that read: "Orban is a dictator. He lies to the people. He steals from the country. He must resign." The message also included a link to a leaked document that allegedly exposed Orban's involvement in a corruption scandal. The website was restored after a few hours, but the damage was done.
 
Another example of websites that have been hacked by Hunhack 1.0 is the website of the Hungarian National Bank, the central bank of Hungary. On April 22, 2023, hackers used Hunhack 1.0 to access the bank's database and transfer millions of forints, the Hungarian currency, to various accounts belonging to anti-government activists and organizations. The hackers also posted a message on the website that read: "The money belongs to the people. We are taking it back. Down with Orban and his cronies." The bank reported the incident to the authorities and tried to recover the funds, but it was too late.
