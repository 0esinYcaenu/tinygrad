# Microcomputer Systems: The 8086/8088 Family - A Classic Textbook on Microprocessor Architecture and Design
 
Microcomputer Systems: The 8086/8088 Family is a textbook written by Yu-cheng Liu and Glenn A. Gibson, published by Prentice-Hall in 1986. It covers the architecture, programming, and design of microcomputer systems based on the Intel 8086 and 8088 microprocessors, which were widely used in personal computers and embedded systems in the 1980s.

The book provides a comprehensive exploration of both the software and hardware aspects of 16-bit microprocessors, including assembler language programming, modular programming, byte and string manipulation, I/O programming, multiprogramming, system bus structure, I/O interfaces, semiconductor memory, multiprocessor configuration, VLSI processing and supporting devices, and the 80286/80287 processors. It also includes an appendix with the complete instruction set of the 8086/8088 microprocessors.
 
The book is intended for undergraduate and graduate students of computer science and engineering, as well as for professionals who want to learn about the fundamentals of microcomputer systems. It assumes some prior knowledge of digital logic design and assembly language programming. The book is organized into 13 chapters, each with a summary, exercises, and references. The book also provides numerous examples, diagrams, tables, and code listings to illustrate the concepts and techniques discussed.
 
Microcomputer Systems: The 8086/8088 Family is a classic textbook that has been cited by many researchers and practitioners in the field of computer architecture and design. It is still relevant today for anyone who wants to understand the principles and practices of microcomputer systems based on the 8086/8088 family of microprocessors.

The 8086 and 8088 microprocessors were introduced by Intel in 1978 and 1979, respectively. They were the first members of the x86 family of microprocessors, which is still widely used today in various forms and applications. The 8086 and 8088 microprocessors had a 16-bit internal data bus and a 20-bit address bus, allowing them to access up to 1 MB of memory. The main difference between them was that the 8086 had a 16-bit external data bus, while the 8088 had an 8-bit external data bus, making it cheaper and easier to interface with peripheral devices.
 
The 8086 and 8088 microprocessors were designed to be compatible with the earlier 8080 and 8085 microprocessors, which had an 8-bit internal data bus and a 16-bit address bus. However, they also introduced several new features and enhancements, such as segmented memory addressing, instruction pipelining, hardware multiplication and division, string instructions, and interrupt handling. The 8086 and 8088 microprocessors also supported two operating modes: real mode and protected mode. In real mode, the microprocessor could access only the first 64 KB of memory using direct addressing. In protected mode, the microprocessor could access the entire 1 MB of memory using segment registers and offsets.
 
The 8086 and 8088 microprocessors were used in many popular personal computers and embedded systems in the 1980s, such as the IBM PC, the IBM PC XT, the IBM PC AT, the Compaq Portable, the Apple IIe Enhanced, the Tandy TRS-80 Model 100, and the Osborne 1. They were also used in various industrial and military applications, such as CNC machines, robots, radars, and missiles. The 8086 and 8088 microprocessors were succeeded by the 80186 and 80188 microprocessors in 1982, which had higher clock speeds and integrated peripherals. However, the 8086 and 8088 microprocessors remained in production until the early 1990s.
