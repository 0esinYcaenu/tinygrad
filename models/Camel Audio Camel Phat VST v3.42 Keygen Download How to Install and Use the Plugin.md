- If you want to add some grit and crunch to your guitar sound, you can use the Tube or Mech distortion modules. You can also adjust the Drive, Tone and Mix knobs to find the right balance between distortion and clean signal.
- If you want to enhance the low end of your bass or kick drum, you can use the Magic EQ module. It has a special algorithm that boosts the low frequencies without making them muddy or boomy. You can also use the Low Cut filter to remove any unwanted sub-bass.
- If you want to create some rhythmic modulation effects on your synth or pad, you can use the LFOs and the envelope follower modules. You can assign them to modulate any parameter of the plugin, such as the filter cutoff, the distortion amount or the mix level. You can also sync them to the tempo of your project or use them in free mode.
- If you want to have some fun and experiment with different sounds, you can use the X/Y pad and the Randomize button. The X/Y pad lets you control two parameters at once by moving your mouse or using a MIDI controller. The Randomize button generates a random preset for you every time you click it.
