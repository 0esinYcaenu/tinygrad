Moreover, the application also saves the generated codes for your model automatically, so you don't have to worry about losing your work. However, if you want to have more control over the code generation process and the output files, then UML Lab is a suitable option for you. UML Lab lets you open multiple files at the same time and switch between them easily. This way, you can compare and edit different versions of your code and select the one that best fits your needs.

How to use UML Lab
  
To use UML Lab, you need to install the application on your computer and create an account. You can then log in and start a new project or open an existing one.

When you are satisfied with your model, you can generate the code for it by clicking on the Generate Code button. UML Lab will automatically create the files and folders for your code and save them in your project directory. You can then open the files and view the generated code in the code editor. You can also modify the code and see the changes reflected in your model.
  
UML Lab also allows you to open multiple files at the same time and switch between them easily. This way, you can compare and edit different versions of your code and select the one that best fits your needs. You can also export your code to other formats, such as XML, HTML, PDF, etc.
