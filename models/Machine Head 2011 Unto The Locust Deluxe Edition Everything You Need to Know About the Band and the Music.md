The deluxe edition of Unto The Locust includes three bonus tracks, a DVD documentary on the making of the album, and expanded artwork. The bonus tracks are cover versions of Judas Priest's "The Sentinel", Rush's "Witch Hunt" and an acoustic rendition of "Darkness Within", one of the most emotional and powerful songs on the album. The DVD documentary features interviews with the band members, producer Juan Urteaga and guest musicians, as well as behind-the-scenes footage of the recording process. The expanded artwork features stunning illustrations by Paul Gerrard that depict the themes and concepts of the album.
 
Unto The Locust is a musical journey that explores the dark side of human nature, the struggle for survival, the power of faith and the beauty of hope. The album consists of seven original songs that range from epic thrash metal anthems to melodic acoustic ballads. The opening track "I Am Hell (Sonata In C#)" is a three-part suite that combines classical strings, brutal riffs and haunting vocals. The title track "Locust" is a metaphor for the destructive forces that plague humanity, while "This Is The End" is a fast-paced song that reflects on mortality and legacy. "Darkness Within" is a soulful song that deals with depression and addiction, while "Pearls Before The Swine" is a heavy groove metal song that criticizes hypocrisy and corruption. "Who We Are" is a uplifting song that features a children's choir and celebrates resilience and unity. The album closes with the bonus tracks that pay tribute to some of the band's musical influences.
